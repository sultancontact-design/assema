# Token shape

The full DTCG example for the x-height correction, referenced from section 3 of
`SKILL.md`.

The point of the `$extensions` block is that the committed `$value` is
*checkable*: a build can read `derived.expression` and its `inputs`, recompute,
and fail if they disagree. A number without its derivation is a literal that
happens to be right today.

## Field notes

**Namespace.** DTCG requires `$extensions` keys to be reverse-DNS. Use the
project's existing namespace if it has one — grep for `"$extensions"` in the
token files — otherwise ask for the organisation's domain rather than inventing
one. `com.equinor.typography` above is the reference implementation's.

**`method`.** `OS/2.sxHeight` and `measured:x-glyph-bounds` are not the same
quality of evidence, and the difference matters when someone re-derives the
number against a newer release of the font. `scripts/xheight.py` emits it — copy
it through rather than deciding it yourself.

**`instance`.** For a variable font, record the axis location the metrics were
read at (`{"wght": 400}`). A correction derived from a font with an `MVAR` table
is only valid at that point; without it, the token cannot be rechecked and a
reader cannot tell whether it applies to the weight they are setting.

**`source` without a URL.** When the font was measured from a local file, record
the path plus the `sha256` the script emits. The checksum pins the exact bytes
measured, which is the property the URL was standing in for.

**The reference family carries `$value: 1` *and* its own metrics.** Both are
deliberate. A consumer that special-cases "the family without a factor" breaks
the first time the reference changes — and the emitter in
[`emit-font-faces.md`](emit-font-faces.md) reads `metrics` for every family, so
omitting the block there makes it throw on the first iteration.

**`metrics.family`** is the name from the font's `name` table, which
`scripts/xheight.py` emits. The emitter uses it rather than the token key, so
the `@font-face` family name matches the binary rather than whatever the token
happened to be called.
