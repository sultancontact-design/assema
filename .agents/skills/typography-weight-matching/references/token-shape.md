# Token shape

The DTCG output of `scripts/stem.py --format tokens`, referenced from section 6
of `SKILL.md`. Two token kinds: a **matched weight** per tier for the target
family, and the **letter-spacing port factor** that scales the reference's
tracking ramp for it. Both carry the derivation and the exact bytes they were
measured from.

The example below is the bundled Inter matched against itself at tier 400 —
the one pair the selftest can run without a second font — exactly as emitted.
A real pair reads the same way with two different `sha256`s and a
`correctionValue` other than 1; Inter against Equinor at ×1.137288 gives
`376.2 / 458.5 / 552.7` for tiers 300 / 400 / 500, re-measured with the current
script on 2026-09-04 and unchanged from 2026-09-01. Equinor is proprietary, so
that pair is not in the selftest; re-run the section 3 example to check it.

## Field notes

**`$value` is a plain number**, not a `100`–`900` keyword. CSS accepts any
weight in 1–1000 including fractions, and a variable font renders it.
Platforms that cannot — React Native rounds to hundreds — are the reason
section 6 asks about the target before emitting: on those, `--snap 100` records
the snapped value, the measured one and the residual rather than pretending
458.5 was 500 all along, like this (Inter against itself, tier 400):

```json
{
  "expression": "stem(target, w) = stem(reference, tier) / correction; value = round(w / 100) * 100",
  "inputs": {
    "tier": 400,
    "correction": 1.0,
    "correctionValue": 1.0,
    "instance": {
      "wght": 400
    }
  },
  "measured": 400.1,
  "residual": -0.1
}
```

**`derived.inputs.correction`** is the DTCG alias of the x-height correction
token when `--correction-token` names it, and the bare factor otherwise;
`correctionValue` is always the resolved number. Pass the alias: a matched
weight depends on the perceived size the pair is set at, and the alias is what
lets an audit follow that dependency back to the fonts.

**`metrics.method`.** `outline:mid-height-stem` means the widest ink run
across the glyph at its vertical midpoint, from the outline, not a rendered
bitmap and not the bounding box — the two diverge at axis extremes (section 1).
`glyph` is the letter measured; `l` is the default because it is a single
straight stem in almost every Latin design.

**`instance`** records the reference's axis location the tier was measured at.
With `--opsz` the optical size is pinned too, which is how the per-size table
in section 4 is produced; without it the reference's default `opsz` applies and
the token says so by omission. A pinned `opsz` changes the right `correction`
as well as the stem: `correctionValue` must be the x-height correction sampled
at that `opsz`, and `--correction-token` must then name the *per-step* token
from `typography-x-height-alignment`'s outcome 2 (`x-height-correction.display.5xl`),
not the flat one — the alias and the value agree only when both are the
step's. With no per-step token in the project, pass the bare factor and let
`instance.opsz` record where it holds.

**The `letter-spacing` token is the missing-axis compensation** (section 4),
one per tier, keyed by the reference tier. It is a plain `number` in the
*target's* em — DTCG's `dimension` allows only `px` and `rem`, and this value
is relative to the element's own size — with `units.px` at the `--px` size,
which is what the `com.equinor.figma` block binds (a Figma variable bound to
letter-spacing is applied in pixels whatever unit the layer shows; checked in
the Plugin API 2026-09-09), and `units.percent` for humans beside it. Without
`--px` the Figma block carries no value and says why. `reference`
is the reference's side space at the pinned `opsz`, `target` the target's at
its matched weight, `correction` the x-height correction at that same `opsz`
(alias or bare factor, as for the weights). The self-pair example above pins
Inter at opsz 32 against its own default opsz 14, which is why a face against
itself comes out at −0.027em: that is the axis alone. Figma takes it with the
`LETTER_SPACING` scope on the text style.

**The port factor's inputs are both side-space records**, including the
weights they were measured at, and `metrics.instance` records the reference's
axis location: with `--opsz` pinned the factor moves (0.84 at Inter's default
against 1.13 at opsz 32 for the EDS pair), so the token says which it is. Section 5 insists these are the *matched*
weights; a factor computed with both faces at 400 is a different number, and
the token shows which one you have.

**Namespace.** Reverse-DNS, in code spelling. Use the project's existing one if
it has one — grep for `"$extensions"` in the token files — otherwise ask for the
organisation's domain rather than inventing one.
