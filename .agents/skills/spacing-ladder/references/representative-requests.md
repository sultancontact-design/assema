# Representative requests

Acceptance criteria for this skill, per the authoring gate in the repo's
`CLAUDE.md`. A change that breaks any of these is a regression, whatever else
it improves.

**1. "Build a medium button. How tall is it and what's the padding?"**
→ Ask CSS-only or also Figma/RN; then `spacing.py control --size md
--proportion squished --label md`: inset 16 / 12, label 14px on a 16px
compressed line box, cap 12, padding 16 / 10, height 36 at comfortable — and
24 / 44 at compact / relaxed from the same recipe. The height is read back,
never typed; the padding stays 10 and is not rounded to 12.
*Prevents:* `height: 36px` and `padding: 12px 16px`, which are right today and
wrong at the next density.

**2. "Two buttons side by side, Save and Cancel — what gap?"**
→ `sm`: they are a cluster, one rung below the container's `md`. Say why: the
gap measures box to box, the eye measures ink to ink, and each button brings
its own inset.
*Prevents:* the container gap between siblings, which reads too far apart even
though it is on the ladder.

**3. "A toolbar with a search field in it — how tall?"**
→ Never authored: the field's emergent height plus the `xs` seat rung raw above
and below (`spacing.py strip --control 36`): 52 at comfortable, 36 / 68 at
compact / relaxed. Raw because controls carry no half-leading.
*Prevents:* an authored 56px bar, and optical compensation applied to a box
whose edges are real.

**4. "Port these spacing tokens to compact density."**
→ Same sequence, offset one rung down: every rung and every inset moves
together, no rule changes; `spacing.py tokens --out …` emits all three
densities from the one source. Check that `3xl` at relaxed is flagged
extrapolated.
*Prevents:* a second hand-made table that drifts from the first.

**5. "Here is our button CSS — `padding: 12px 16px; height: 40px`. Is it on
the ladder?"** — the audit case. Reproduce the fixtures with `spacing.py
check`; compare each committed value against what the recipe gives for its
inset, label and cap (`control --size md --proportion squished --label md`:
padding 10, height 36); regenerate the tokens and diff them byte for byte
against what is committed; then read heights back from the browser. The
finding here is the one this skill exists for: a 10 someone rounded to 12,
which pushed the control to 40 and off the grid.
*Prevents:* approving spacing that is on the ladder but on the wrong
relationship, or off the grid by a rounding that looked like tidying.

**6. "Add a leading icon to the medium button."** → Ask CSS-only or also
Figma/RN, as in request 1; then `spacing.py glyph --label md --icon md`: in
CSS the icon is one `<svg class="icon">`, 20px of ink at
comfortable, sitting in the label's 12px cap cell with `margin: −4px` on every
side; the control's `align-items: center` does the rest. Read back the glyph's
centre and the label's cap centre from the rendered button: they coincide.
Across densities the seat is −5 / −4 / −6 for 18 / 20 / 24px glyphs, and the
small button's `sm` label with an `xs` glyph gives 8 / 16 / −4.
*Prevents:* a cap-sized wrapper around the svg with `place-items: center`,
which put the glyph 4px below the button's centre in a measured run, and an
icon size held flat across densities.

A seventh, for routing: **"what line-height goes with 14px?"** is
`typography-scale`, and **"align the paragraphs to the baseline grid"** is the
baseline-grid skill; this skill spaces boxes, not text.
