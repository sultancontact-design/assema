# Typographic scale

A scale is an *algorithm*, not a table of numbers. Ship the formula, derive the
values, and let one constant — the base size — carry density. Every value below
is reproducible from two lines of arithmetic; nothing is authored twice.

## 1. Sizes: one base, one ratio, one snap

```
size(i) = round(base × r^(i / n), snap)
```

- `r = 2`, `n` steps per octave. The scale **doubles every n steps** — that is
  the whole point of an octave-based ratio: `lg` → five steps up is exactly
  `2 × lg`, at every density. Exact in the formula; the snap costs 0.5px on a
  few pairs, enumerated in [`references/positions.md`](references/positions.md).
  Arbitrary ratios (1.25, 1.333) have no such landmark, so the ends drift.
- `i` is the step index, offset so that one named step *is* the base. EDS uses
  ten steps `xs … 6xl` with `lg` at the base, so `i = labelIndex − 3`.
- `snap` is a rounding grid, not a formatting choice — see below.

```css
/* five steps per octave, base at lg, snapped to half a pixel */
--font-size-md: round(calc(var(--_base) * pow(2, -1/5)), 0.03125rem);
--font-size-lg: var(--_base);
--font-size-xl: round(calc(var(--_base) * pow(2,  1/5)), 0.03125rem);
```

**Snap to half a pixel (`0.03125rem`), not to whole pixels.** Whole-pixel
rounding is too coarse at the small end, where steps are closest together: it
misses the intended ratio by up to 38.9% against half-pixel's 12.1%, and puts a
+9.09% step next to a +16.67% one in the range that carries body text. Full
figures in [`references/positions.md`](references/positions.md). Half-pixel keeps the small
end proportional while still landing on values a human can say out loud, and
sub-pixel *type* renders fine — it is sub-pixel *layout* that causes trouble,
which is why line-heights snap differently (section 2). Note that `0.03125rem`
is half a pixel only while the root is 16px: `round()` snaps in the unit it is
given, so changing the root changes the grid.

**State the constants somewhere durable.** `base`, `n`, the step offset and the
snap are the entire scale: with them every token regenerates, without them the
tokens have to be reverse-engineered.

## 2. Line-height: a curve indexed by step, snapped to the grid

Large text needs proportionally *less* leading than small text, so a single
ratio is wrong at one end or the other. Use a cubic across the scale — the
multiplier barely moves for the first half and falls away sharply at the top,
which is an ease-*in* on the leading, not an ease-out:

```
multiplier(n) = max − (n / (N−1))³ × drop
line-height   = round(fontSize × multiplier(n), 4px)
```

Two curves, because reading and scanning want different things:

| Curve        | max  | drop | For                                        |
| ------------ | ---- | ---- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `default`    | 1.39 | 0.29 | Read text — prose, meant to be consumed     |
| `compressed` | 1.13 | 0.13 | Scanned text — UI labels; a wrapped label must read as one block |

Keep both. Collapsing to one curve plus a literal ratio at the composition layer
looks equivalent and is not — see [`references/positions.md`](references/positions.md).

**The 4px grid is the invariant; the ratio is the derived value.** Snapping the
*result* means the rendered percentages come out non-monotonic —
`152, 133, 143, 150, 130, 133, 131, 129, 113, 108` — which looks like a bug and
is not. Each line box lands on the layout grid, which is the property that
composes; the ratio is just what that costs at that step. Say so in a comment,
because someone will find the table and file an issue.

Name the second curve for what it does: `compressed` describes leading, while
`squished` is Nathan Curtis's term for a *spacing* proportion, and reusing it
makes two unrelated ideas collide inside one expression.

## 3. Density is one number

```
compact 0.875   comfortable 1   relaxed 1.15625
```

Density sets `base`. Everything else — sizes, line-heights, and any measure
derived from a font size — follows without a second table. Ship it as an axis
on the root:

```css
[data-density='compact'] { --_base: 0.875rem; }
```

The attribute must sit on the element that declares `--_base`: `[data-density]`
on a wrapper does not reach a `--_base` declared on `:root`.

Derive companions from the step rather than tabulating them: an icon gap of
`round(fontSize × 0.618, 2px)` stays in proportion at every density, where a
flat `8px` only looks right at one.

**Known trade-off, worth deciding explicitly:** if the line-height curve is
indexed by *step label* (`xs` is always `n=0`), then density shifts the size
ramp underneath a fixed curve, and the same rendered px size gets different
leading depending on which label produced it:

```
16px:  compact/xl = 20px    comfortable/lg = 24px    relaxed/md = 24px
```

Indexing by *absolute size* instead makes leading purely a function of size.
Both are defensible. Label-indexing is the incumbent in EDS and was kept
deliberately — changing it moves rendered values in a shipped product, which is
a redesign, not a fix. Decide, record the choice, and do not rediscover it.

## 4. Building a scale for a paired family

When a display or mono face sits beside the text face, equal nominal sizes do
not look equal, so the correction has to live *somewhere* — either in the ramp
or in the `@font-face`. Which one depends on the target, and the two options
are genuinely different outputs, not two packagings of one.
`typography-x-height-alignment` produces the factor this section consumes.

**Ask before emitting anything:**

> Will this be used in a CSS-only environment, or also in Figma, React Native,
> or other non-CSS targets?

The answer changes the output, not just the packaging.

### CSS only → one scale, corrected in `@font-face`

Emit a single size ramp and let `size-adjust` correct the secondary face.
It corrects continuously, so it also fixes sizes that are not scale steps.

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Equinor';
  src: url('EquinorVariable-VF.woff2') format('woff2-variations');
  size-adjust: 113.7288%; /* generated from the correction token, not typed */
}
```

Both families now use `--font-size-md` and look the same size. Nothing else
changes.

### Also Figma or React Native → one scale per family

`size-adjust` is a CSS `@font-face` descriptor. React Native never parses it and
Figma has no equivalent, so both would render the uncorrected face while CSS
looked right. Emit **two ramps**:

```
step   text (reference)   display (× 1.137288, snapped)   line-height (shared)
md               14px                          16px                       20px
lg               16px                          18px                       24px
xl             18.5px                          21px                       24px
5xl              32px                        36.5px                       36px
```

Four rules make this work:

- **Correct the font size only.** Apply the factor to each step and re-snap to
  the same grid (`round(step × correction, 0.5px)`). When the reference carries
  an `opsz` axis the factor is per step, not per family — Inter's x-height
  falls 5.5% from opsz 14 to 32 — so sample it at each step first:
  `typography-x-height-alignment/references/optical-size.md`.
- **Share the line-heights.** Both families use the reference ramp's
  line-heights at the same step: aligned faces look the same size there, so
  they get the same line box and the 4px rhythm holds across families.
- **Take `size-adjust` out.** Keep both mechanisms and you double-correct.
- **Check the correction survives the snap.** Below half a snap unit at the
  smallest step it is erased there: `× 1.019345` lands as 0.00% at `xs`/`sm` but
  +3.57% at `md`. Figures in [`references/positions.md`](references/positions.md).

`scripts/scale.py --correction 1.137288 --display Equinor` emits this branch
with one factor (positions §8 for the per-step limit). Two numbers under one
step label is the correct outcome: `display-md = 16` beside `text-md = 14`
means *the same perceived size*, reached from different nominal values. Both
designer and developer see 16 for a display step, with no hidden multiplier.
Off-scale sizes get no correction — acceptable, they are outside the system.

## 5. Emit: tokens first, then CSS and Figma

`scripts/scale.py` derives every number from the constants and emits them,
**tokens first** — the DTCG file is the source, and CSS and Figma are outputs
derived from it, never the other way round:

```bash
skill=.claude/skills/typography-scale             # where the installed copy lives
python3 $skill/scripts/scale.py --check                        # fixtures still hold
python3 $skill/scripts/scale.py --out tokens                   # one file per density
python3 $skill/scripts/scale.py --format figma --out figma     # variables + text styles
```

Token shape: [`references/token-shape.md`](references/token-shape.md). Figma —
density as modes, styles bound to variables, no-MCP fallback: [`references/figma.md`](references/figma.md).

Keep the algorithm legible in the CSS rather than only in the generator:

```css
--font-size-xl: round(calc(var(--_base) * pow(2, 1/5)), 0.03125rem);
```

A reader can see the scale; changing density changes one variable and the
browser recomputes. Platforms that cannot evaluate expressions — Figma, React
Native — get **baked values from the same source**, never hand-transcribed.

`round()` and `pow()` are CSS Values 4 math functions. `round()` is Baseline
*newly*, which is a question about the target, not a verdict — **so ask it
rather than deciding for the reader:**

> Does this need to support older browsers, or only evergreen ones?

- **Evergreen only** — a centrally managed or auto-updating fleet, or a
  `browserslist` that says so. Emit the expressions. This is the whole point:
  the scale stays legible and density recomputes in the browser.
- **Older browsers in scope** — emit baked values everywhere and keep the
  expression in a comment, so the derivation survives even though the browser
  never sees it.

Defaulting to baked values "to be safe" is not neutral: it discards the
readable artefact for a constraint the project may not have, silently. If no
matrix is declared and nobody answers, say which way you went. Verify status at
`https://api.webstatus.dev/v1/features/round-mod-rem` (caniuse has no feature
for `round()`) rather than recalling it — *newly* since 2024-05-17, checked
2026-09-04; expect *widely* around late 2026, which retires this question.

## 6. Verification discipline

A scale is a claim that N numbers all follow from four constants. Test it:

- **Every emitted value equals what the formula gives** — checked differently
  per branch of §5. Expressions shipped: read back computed styles from a real
  browser, because the thing under test is rounding, where a generator's
  `round()` can disagree with CSS `round(nearest)` on exact half-way values.
  Baked values shipped: there is no expression for the browser to evaluate, so
  recompute the literals from the four constants; a readback there only proves
  the browser can parse a number.
- **The five octave exceptions are a fixture.** The pairs that miss a clean 2×
  are enumerated in [`references/positions.md`](references/positions.md) §6. A
  sixth means a constant or a snap moved, and fails the build.
- **Auditing an existing build** runs in a fixed order: reproduce the preset
  fixture, recompute the artefacts from the constants, regenerate and diff
  byte-for-byte, then read values.
- **Every deviation from a previous build is enumerated.** Anything not on the
  list fails the harness. Silence is never a pass.
- **Extrapolated values are flagged where they live** — token, CSS, harness
  output. A scale extended past its evidence says so at the point of use.
- **No off-scale sizes.** A hard-coded `20px` is outside the system and gets
  none of its guarantees: grid, paired line-height, or any step correction.

## The EDS preset

Asked for a scale "based on the Equinor Design System"? The constants and the
comfortable ramp as a fixture: [`references/eds-preset.md`](references/eds-preset.md).

## Positions this skill takes

Four choices here cost something, and a system under delivery pressure will be
tempted to simplify each: half-pixel snapping, the second line-height curve,
deriving weight and tracking per step, and ten close steps rather than six wide
ones — this is a scale for an application interface, not a page. Each rests on
a measurement, not a preference, and the file also records two limits where the
snapped output does not deliver what the formula promises:
[`references/positions.md`](references/positions.md).

If you simplify any of them, do it knowing the cost and write down why.

## Representative requests

Four acceptance criteria — the EDS build, the compressed line-heights, the
two-family Figma push, and auditing a committed scale — plus a routing check:
[`references/representative-requests.md`](references/representative-requests.md).

## Related

- **`typography-x-height-alignment`** — run it *first* when two families are
  involved: it measures the fonts and produces the correction factor that
  section 4 consumes.
- **`css-authoring`** — the channel-variable pattern for `--_base`, and the
  general rule for verifying browser support. Not yet published in this
  repository; it is the draft on `origin/skill/css-authoring`.
- **`typography-weight-matching`** — matching weight and letter-spacing across
  a pair, indexed against these steps.

## Provenance

From the EDS token rework in **`equinor/ids-meetup-oslo-26`**
(Equinor-internal), prepared for the Into Design Systems Oslo meetup on
9 September 2026: `src/formulas.ts` (the algorithms), `DECISIONS.md` decision 1
(indexing the curve by step label), `build/css/typography.css` (the emitted
scale with formulas intact) and `test/deviations.ts` (the enumerated-deviation
discipline in section 6), all under `eds-tokens-reworked/`.

Optical padding — cap height, half-leading, and landing a control on the 4px
grid while keeping an honest line-height — derives from these values but is a
spacing concern, and is out of scope here.
